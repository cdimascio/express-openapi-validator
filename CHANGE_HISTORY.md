### breaking change

By default, request and response validation now stops after the first failure. Only one error will be reported even when multiple may exist. This follows best practices from AJV:
- [Security risks of trusted schemas](https://ajv.js.org/security.html#security-risks-of-trusted-schemas)
- [`allErrors` option](https://ajv.js.org/options.html#allerrors)

To report all validation errors (only recommended in development), option `allErrors` can be set in options `validateRequests` and/or `validateResponses`. For example:

```ts
app.use(
  OpenApiValidator.middleware({
    apiSpec: 'path/to/openapi.json',
    validateRequests: {
      allErrors: true,
    },
    validateResponses: {
      allErrors: true,
    },
  })
);
```
